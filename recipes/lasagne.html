        <p><h3>Lasagne Alla Bolognese Saporite.</h3></p>
        <p>"This is the classic lasagne alla Bolognese recipe from the Emilia region</p>
        <p>in Northern Italy. The Bolognese sauce is made with a mixture of beef and</p>
        <p>pork mince. The addition of prosciutto,red wine, cinnamon, and nutmeg</p>
        <p> make it truly authentic."</p>
        
        <ul>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil,</ul>
        <ul>1 small onion, chopped,</ul>
        <ul>1 carrot, chopped</ul>
        <ul>1 shallot, minced</ul>
        <ul>3 ½ ounces prosciutto, chopped</ul>
        <ul>11 ounces ground pork</ul>
        <ul>11 ounces ground beef</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</ul>
        <ul>salt to taste</ul>
        <ul>6 fluid ounces red wine</ul>
        <ul>21 ounces peeled San Marzano tomatoes</ul>
        <ul>6 tablespoons butter</ul>
        <ul>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</ul>
        <ul>3 ¼ cups milk</ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</ul>
        <ul>salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>
        <ul>11 ounces lasagna noodles</ul>
        <ul>2 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste"</ul>

        <ol><p>Step 1</p> 

            Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is translucent and prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef; season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
            </ol>

        <ol><p>Step 2</p> 

            Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix well; bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and flavors of Bolognese sauce have combined, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
            </ol>

        <ol><p>Step 3</p> 

            Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add flour. Whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour in milk and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until white sauce thickens enough to cover the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
            </ol>

        <ol><p>Step 4</p> 

            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Lay noodles on a clean towel and pat dry.
            </ol>

        <ol><p>Step 5</p> 

            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </ol>

        <Ol><p>Step 6</p> 

            Pour a ladleful of Bolognese sauce and a ladleful of white sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 3 or 4 lasagna noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the white sauce and 1/3 of the Bolognese sauce. Sprinkle some of the Parmesan cheese on top; cover with lasagna noodles. Repeat layers, ending with white sauce and Parmesan cheese.
            </Ol>

        <ol><p>Step 7</p> 

            Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes before slicing.
