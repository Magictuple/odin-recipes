      <p><h3>Indian Chicken Curry.</h3></p>
      <p>This is an adaptation of yellow chicken curry from India. The aromas</p>
      <p>and flavors are a delight to the senses! It is best served with fresh</p>   
      <p>Naan bread and Jasmine or Basmati rice. </p>
      <p></p>

      <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong></ul>

      
      <ul>3 tablespoons olive oil </ul>
      <ul>1 small onion, chopped </ul>
      <ul>2 cloves garlic, minced </ul>
      <ul>3 tablespoons curry powder </ul>
      <ul>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </ul>
      <ul>1 teaspoon paprika </ul>
      <ul>1 bay leaf </ul>
      <ul>½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</ul>
      <ul>½ teaspoon white sugar </ul>
      <ul>salt to taste</ul>
      <ul>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces </ul>
      <ul>1 tablespoon tomato paste </ul>
      <ul>1 cup plain yogurt </ul>
      <ul>1 cup plain yogurt </ul>
      <ul>¾ cup coconut milk </ul>
      <ul>½ lemon, juiced </ul>
      <ul>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper </ul>


      <ol><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p> 

          Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is translucent and prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef; season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
          </ol>

      <ol><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p> 

          Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix well; bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and flavors of Bolognese sauce have combined, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
          </ol>

      <ol><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p> 

          Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add flour. Whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour in milk and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until white sauce thickens enough to cover the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
          </ol>

      <ol><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p> 

          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Lay noodles on a clean towel and pat dry.
          </ol>

      <ol><p><strong>Step 5</strong></p> 

          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
          </ol>

      <ol><p><strong>Step 6</strong></p> 

          Pour a ladleful of Bolognese sauce and a ladleful of white sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 3 or 4 lasagna noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the white sauce and 1/3 of the Bolognese sauce. Sprinkle some of the Parmesan cheese on top; cover with lasagna noodles. Repeat layers, ending with white sauce and Parmesan cheese.
          </Ol>

      <ol><p><strong>Step 7</strong></p> 

          Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes before slicing.
